                I'm <span>Ashley Vo</span>. Right now, I'm pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego. I received my Associate's from Orange Coast College in 2024 and transferred.

                My path towards data and development was kickstarted by being attached to my computer a lot as a kid. I doodled a lot, so I naturally was fond of the idea of making things and sharing them with people. An interest in numbers and deriving meaning from them stemmed from me playing numerous video games. I found all sorts of cool tools and diagrams people would make. Some of them concerned playerbase statistics and others were about maximizing character stats. At the time, I always thought, "Wow, these people are smarter than me!"

                Outside of school and academics, I draw and play video games. I used to be a big MMORPG player, with <i>Guild Wars 2</i> having been my main game for some years. After that, I figured it was time to move on, and now I predominantly play JRPGs! Here's what I'm currently playing:

                    <i>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</i> (2025)

                <li>
                    <i>Final Fantasy VIII Remastered</i> (2019)
